		The University of Nebraska Omaha (Omaha or UNO) is a public research university in Omaha, Nebraska.
		Founded in 1908 by faculty from the Omaha Presbyterian Theological Seminary as a private non-sectarian college,
		the university was originally known as the University of Omaha. Originally meant to provide a Christian-based 
		education free from ecclesiastical control, the university served as a strong alternative to the city's
 		many successful religiously affiliated institutionsThe university became a public municipal institution in 1930,
 		and it moved from the North Omaha campus to its present main location at 60th and Dodge Street in 1938.
